    "text": "On February 15, 2023, Spanish radio station Cadena SER alongside El Pais, broke the news that FC Barcelona were being investigated by Madrid based court and the Spanish Tax agency. The investigation involves Spanish football club FC Barcelona, and former Vice-President of the Technical Committee of Referees(CTA) of the Spanish Football Federation Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. The case is ongoing and is centered around payments from the Spanish club based in ‘Catalunya’ to Negreira of roughly €8 million during the latter’s time at the CTA from 2001 through 2018.\nThis revelation sparked intense debate as data revealed potential foul play. Despite payments occurring for over 17 years, the highest paid check were during the 2015/16 through 2017/18 seasons. During this period, how many penalty calls went in favor and against FC Barcelona compared to their main rivals and the league?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/LaLigadata - Sheet1.csv\")\n\n\n## Bar graph for Penalties In Favor of LaLiga teams\n\nBarcelona &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Abbreviation == \"BAR\"\n  )\n\nRealmadrid &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Abbreviation == \"RMA\"\n  )\n\nAtleticomadrid &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Abbreviation == \"ATM\"\n  )\n\nBar1For &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = data, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Barcelona, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Realmadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Atleticomadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"skyblue\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"LaLiga Teams\", \n    y=\"Penalties Awarded For Teams\", \n    title=\"Barcelona PKs vs. LaLiga (2015/16 - 2017/18)\", \n    subtitle=\"Across three seasons, Barcelona were awarded the most penalty calls\\nin their favor, as well as the least calls against.\", \n    caption=\"\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\nBar2VS &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = data, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Barcelona, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Realmadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Atleticomadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"skyblue\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Penalties Awarded Against Teams\", \n    title=\"\", \n    subtitle=\"\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBref.com | Kevin Artiles Fernandez\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\nplot_grid(Bar1For, Bar2VS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA penalty at any point in the match changes the entire momentum of the game. Compared to the rest of the league including their main rivals, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, receiving the most penalties called in their favor, and the least against, certainly set a tempo for the season.\nBut what about red cards? Does the number of red cards given to Barcelona players and against their oponents tell a different story?\n\n\nCode\nRCardForSummary &lt;- data |&gt; \n  group_by(Abbreviation, Season) |&gt; \n

opponents.\nLike penalties, a red card has a massive impact on the match. This said, some of their rivals faced somewhat similar benefits, such as Real Madrid.\nBut how did the refereeing decisions impact the actual matches? Were they enough to swing the results in favor of the ‘Blaugranas’ or does it stay average compared to the rest of the league?\n\n\nCode\nteam_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(Abbreviation) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    refAdvantageIndex = sum(PKforAtt - PKattVS - CrdRfor + CrdRvs),\n    PointsperMatch = sum(Points) / sum(MPfor)\n  )\n\n# Filter subsets\nBarcelona &lt;- team_summary |&gt; filter(Abbreviation == \"BAR\")\nRealmadrid &lt;- team_summary |&gt; filter(Abbreviation == \"RMA\")\nAtleticomadrid &lt;- team_summary |&gt; filter(Abbreviation == \"ATM\")\n\n# Scatterplot \nggplot(team_summary, aes(x = refAdvantageIndex, y = PointsperMatch)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = filter(team_summary, Abbreviation == \"BAR\"),\n             aes(x = refAdvantageIndex, y = PointsperMatch),\n             color = \"red\", size = 5) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(team_summary, Abbreviation == \"RMA\"),\n             aes(x = refAdvantageIndex, y = PointsperMatch),\n             color = \"darkblue\", size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(team_summary, Abbreviation == \"ATM\"),\n             aes(x = refAdvantageIndex, y = PointsperMatch),\n             color = \"skyblue\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = Abbreviation), size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Refereeing Advantage Index (RAI)\", \n    y=\"Points Per Match\", \n    title=\"Barcelona's RAI is an outlier compared to the rest of the league\", \n    subtitle=\"With a total of +49, arbitrary decisions in favor of Barcelona has often correlated with a win for the 'Blaugranas'\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBref.com | Kevin Artiles Fernandez\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 7.5)\n  ) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 10, xmax = Inf, ymin = 1.5, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1) + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 20, y = 2.0,\n           label = \"Suspicious arbitrary decisions zone\",\n           size = 2.5, color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone looking at these, it is completely fair for someone to have suspicions when looking at Barcelona’s net positive of +49. A difference of over 20 with their closest chasing rivals, Real Madrid, who won the title in the 2016/17 season.\nAdding to this, the results in the league only look more suspicious when considering Barcelona’s result in European competition, falling early in the UEFA Champions League in all three of these seasons, with their last European title coming in the 2015/16 season.\nFast forward to 2025 and Barcelona are the current reigning LaLiga Champions. While we await the final verdict of the ongoing case against FC Barcelona for sports corruption, it is not a surprise that LaLiga clubs have made their position clear to protect their interests on the case."
