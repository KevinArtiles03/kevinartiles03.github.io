    "text": "On February 15, 2023, Spanish radio station Cadena SER alongside El Pais, broke the news that FC Barcelona were being investigated by Madrid based court and the Spanish Tax agency. The investigation involves Spanish football club FC Barcelona, and former Vice-President of the Technical Committee of Referees(CTA) of the Spanish Football Federation Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. The case is ongoing and is centered around payments from the Spanish club based in ‘Catalunya’ to Negreira of roughly €8 million during the latter’s time at the CTA from 2001 through 2018.\nThis revelation sparked intense debate as data revealed potential foul play. Despite payments occurring for over 17 years, the highest paid check were during the 2015/16 through 2017/18 seasons. During this period, how many penalty calls went in favor and against FC Barcelona compared to their main rivals and the league?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/LaLigadata - Sheet1.csv\")\n\n\n## Bar graph for Penalties In Favor of LaLiga teams\n\nBarcelona &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Abbreviation == \"BAR\"\n  )\n\nRealmadrid &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Abbreviation == \"RMA\"\n  )\n\nAtleticomadrid &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Abbreviation == \"ATM\"\n  )\n\nBar1For &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = data, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Barcelona, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Realmadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Atleticomadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKforAtt), weight = PKforAtt), fill = \"skyblue\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"LaLiga Teams\", \n    y=\"Penalties Awarded For Teams\", \n    title=\"Barcelona PKs vs. LaLiga (2015/16 - 2017/18)\", \n    subtitle=\"Across three seasons, Barcelona were awarded the most penalty calls\\nin their favor, as well as the least calls against.\", \n    caption=\"\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\nBar2VS &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = data, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Barcelona, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Realmadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data = Atleticomadrid, aes(x = reorder(Abbreviation, PKattVS), weight = PKattVS), fill = \"skyblue\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Penalties Awarded Against Teams\", \n    title=\"\", \n    subtitle=\"\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBref.com | Kevin Artiles Fernandez\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\nplot_grid(Bar1For, Bar2VS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA penalty at any point in the match changes the entire momentum of the game.

A difference of over 20 with their closest chasing rivals, Real Madrid, who won the title in the 2016/17 season.\nAdding to this, the results in the league only look more suspicious when considering Barcelona’s result in European competition, falling early in the UEFA Champions League in all three of these seasons, with their last European title coming in the 2014/15 season.\nFast forward to 2025 and Barcelona are the current reigning LaLiga Champions. While we await the final verdict of the ongoing case against FC Barcelona for sports corruption, it is not a surprise that LaLiga clubs have made their position clear to protect their interests on the case."

Breaking into the Top 3 is already a marvelous season. The Huskers would go on to win the league title that season, sharing it alongside Michigan State. Despite falling short in the Big Ten tournament, Nebraska reached the 2023 NCAA Elite Eight, netting their best finish in the national tournament.\nBut Dale wasn’t the only scorer for Nebraska. With big names like Sarah Weber, Florence Belzille, and Sadie Waite pushing the Husker offense, Nebraska was on the front foot in the league. The question now becomes: How many goals did Nebraska score compared to the league across the three seasons, two with Dale and the following after the English forward’s graduation?\n\n\nCode\nleagueAVG &lt;- big_ten |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarise(Goals = mean(Goals, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Institution = \"League Average\")\n\nplot_data &lt;- big_ten |&gt;\n  bind_rows(leagueAVG)\n\nplot_data &lt;- plot_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    LegendGroup = case_when(\n      Institution == \"Nebraska\" ~ \"Nebraska\",\n      Institution == \"Michigan St.\" ~ \"Michigan State\",\n      Institution == \"League Average\" ~ \"League Average\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other Teams\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\ncolor_map &lt;- c(\n  \"Nebraska\" = \"red\",\n  \"Michigan State\" = \"green\",\n  \"League Average\" = \"orange\",\n  \"Other Teams\" = \"lightgray\"\n)\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(\n  x = Season,\n  y = Goals,\n  group = Institution,\n  color = LegendGroup\n)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_map) +\n    labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Goals Scored\",\n    color = \"Teams\",\n    title = \"Nebraska outperformed the conference competition in goals scored in 2023.\",\n    subtitle = \"Eleanor Dale was responsible for 42% of the Huskers' goals, leading them to the league championship.\",\n    caption = \"By: Kevin Artiles Fernandez | Source: Big Ten Record Book\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska saw a major spike in offensive performance, especially influenced by the now Southampton forward who scored 42% Nebraska’s goals. The Huskers majorly outclass the Big Ten, scoring well above the league average and even more than their co-league Champions, being the only team to break 60 goals that season in the Big Ten. Dale’s performance in the striker position was simply marvelous, but a striker needs to have a variety of skill sets to score in different situations. Did Dale make use of different goalscoring skill sets or was she only scoring off a singular type of finishing ability?\n\n\nCode\nDaleGoals |&gt;\n  select(\n    GoalNumber,\n    Opponent = GoalScoredVS,\n    GoalType,\n    Location = InorOutBox\n  ) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Eleanor Dale's goal catalogue demonstrates extreme finishing variety.\",\n    subtitle = \"The English forward scored some of the rarest goals in the sport, including a bicycle kick and multiple freekicks.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    GoalNumber = \"Goal #\",\n    Opponent = \"Opponent\",\n    GoalType = \"Goal Type\",\n    Location = \"In/Out of the Box\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_fill(color = \"white\"),\n    locations = cells_body()\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows =\n        GoalType == \"Bicycle Kick\" |\n        GoalType == \"Right Foot Freekick\" |\n        (str_detect(GoalType, \"Volley\") & Location == \"Outside the Box\")\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Kevin Artiles Fernandez  |  **Source:** Nebraska Athletics / Match Footage\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.font.size = 14,\n    data_row.padding = px(6),\n    heading.align = \"left\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEleanor Dale's goal catalogue demonstrates extreme finishing variety.\n\n\nThe English forward scored some of the rarest goals in the sport, including a bicycle kick and multiple freekicks.\n\n\nGoal #\nOpponent\nGoal Type\nIn/Out of the Box\n\n\n\n\n1\nCreighton\nRight Foot Volley\nInside the Box\n\n\n2\nEastern Washington\nBicycle Kick\nInside the Box\n\n\n3\nGonzaga\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n4\nGonzaga\nRight Foot Volley\nInside the Box\n\n\n5\nMissouri\nRight Foot Volley\nOutside the Box\n\n\n6\nMissouri\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n7\nKansas St.\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n8\nKansas St.\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n9\nUC Davis\nHeader\nInside the Box\n\n\n10\nUC Davis\nPenalty\nInside the Box\n\n\n11\nSaint Louis\nLeft Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n12\nSaint Louis\nPenalty\nInside the Box\n\n\n13\nWisconsin\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n14\nRutgers\nRight Foot Freekick\nOutside the Box\n\n\n15\nRutgers\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n16\nNorthwestern\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n17\nNorthwestern\nHeader\nInside the Box\n\n\n18\nIowa\nLeft Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n19\nIowa\nHeader\nInside the Box\n\n\n20\nMaryland\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n21\nMaryland\nHeader\nInside the Box\n\n\n22\nPurdue\nLeft Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n23\nIllinois\nRight Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n24\nOhio St.\nLeft Foot Shot\nInside the Box\n\n\n25\nOhio St.\nHeader\nInside the Box\n\n\n26\nSouth Dakota St.\nHeader\nInside the Box\n\n\n27\nUC Irvine\nLeft Foot Volley\nInside the Box\n\n\n28\nUC Irvine\nRight Foot Freekick\nOutside the Box\n\n\n\nBy: Kevin Artiles Fernandez | Source: Nebraska Athletics / Match Footage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Billingham native employed multiple goal types, including some of the rarest forms of goals in football. But what is even more impressive is the amount of consecutive games in which Dale scored one or more goals. She scored in seven consecutive matches, five of which were consecutive two-goal preformances, a feat which she fell just short of accomplishing again, chaining four two goal performances later in the season. She did not score a hattrick in that season which is surprising considering how many games she came short of taking the ball home. In this season, Dale also broke Nebraska’s record for most shots and shots on target for a Husker player in a single season, demonstrating the strength of the Husker attack, and elevating the English forward to a new level.\nDale signed with Everton following the end of the season and eventually transferred to Southampton, club which she currently represents as she recovers from injury with hopes of fighting for a spot in the squad that will represent England in the upcoming 2027 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Brazil."
